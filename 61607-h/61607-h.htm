<h3 class='c012'>INFLUENZA.</h3>

<p class='c013'>An infectious and contagious disease; most startling in its
methods of sudden appearance and disappearance; its widely
diffused and rapid spread is seen in no other disease; it has
excited universal and general attention; physicians and scientists
have been stimulated and fascinated whilst pursuing their
investigations and studying the disease in its various phases, to
wit: spread, incubation, differences of type, and the exact micro-organism
which invades the system of man, and if there is
more than one that enters together or separately.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Discovery of the Bacillus.</i> In the year 1892, Dr. Richard
Pfeiffer, of the University of Breslau, Silesia, Prussia, discovered
the specific microbe of Influenza, a Bacillus, which is
generally accepted as being the cause of the disease; however,
there are some physicians who dissent.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was found to be present in the lungs, bronchial mucous
membrane, sputum and nasal discharge. It is one of the smallest
of the known bacilli; measures about one micron long and
a one-half micron in breadth. A micron is equal to <span class='fraction'>1<br /><span class='vincula'>25,000</span></span>
of an inch. The bacillus is found singly and in pairs, is non-motile.
Domestic animals are not subject to the Flu, but monkeys
and rabbits can be infected.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Alleged Causes of the “Flu.”</i> It has been attributed to
numerous and varied agencies in the past. Philosophers, physicians
and the people believed the disease to be due to supernatural
phenomena.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some of the causes given were in the main fanciful, freakish
and imaginary, the delusions of minds filled with wonder
or fear, and illusions of the senses, such as:</p>

<p class='c014'>Comets, earthquakes, volcanoes and cosmic dust caused
by the rising and setting of the sun.</p>

<p class='c014'>Se Wulf. Se (the), Wulf, wolf. Probably so named from
the cough of the Flu victim resembling the growl of the wolf;
or from the sudden seizure by the outlaw wolf of its victim.</p>

<p class='c014'>Heafd Flowan. Heafd, head; Flowan, to flow; hence
Head Catarrh.</p>

<p class='c014'>Italiae Febris. Fever of Italy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Le Tac. The Rot; slow recovery, persistent cough, like T.B.</p>

<p class='c014'>Le Horion. The thump or blow; suddenness of the attack
of the Flu.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ladendo. This word is puzzling; it is slang Latin or
Italian or is misspelt. If <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Latendo</span>, it means, the Hidden One,
the Flu. If it is Ludendo, then it may mean, the Tickler or
Laugher, the tickling cough spasms, resembling a person laughing.
In the Epidemic of 1427, the manner of greeting was
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">As-tu eu Ladendo?</span>” Have you had Ladendo?</p>

<p class='c014'>Cephale Catarrhale. Head Catarrh.</p>

<p class='c014'>Coqueluche; from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coq</span>, the male bird; hence crested like
the comb of a cock. Luche means a cap or hood. The wearing
of a cap, cocked or crest shaped, by the victim of the Flu,
gave the name to the disease, hence, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coqueluche</span>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Coccoluche. Is the above word <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coqueluche</span>, Anglicised.
<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">Coc</span> or <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">cocc</span> is Anglo-Saxon for the French word, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coq</span>.</p>

<p class='c014'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Grippe. La,</span> the, and the verb, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">agripper</span>, to grip or
cling to or choke.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Influenza.</i> The world-wide designation by which the disease
is known today; is of Italian origin from the word Influente;
a malign Influence or Influenza from the stars being
the cause. Latin: in, into or upon, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fluo</span> to flow; hence a
flowing in, into or upon; caused by an unseen power or Influence
or Influenza, like the profuse nasal discharge, flowing
from an invisible source.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>THE PERFECT LANGUAGE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Sanskrit literally means “the perfect language,” from san
or sam, with, and krita, perfected or done. It is a mother language,
the ancient language of the Hindus, and called the Infallible
language, because it is based on infallible rules; and also
the language of the Gods.</p>

<p class='c014'>The language contains the root Plu; to flow, to rain, to swim.
Now, whether it is the Anglo-Saxon word, <span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">flowan</span> to flow; or the
Latin words <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pluo</span>, to rain, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fluo</span> to flow; or the German <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">fliessen</span>,
to flow; or the Greek word phleo, to flow; and the Italian
word, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">influente</span>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">influo</span>, and hence Influenza; every one of these
words is drafted from this Sanskrit root Plu; from 1800 B.C.
downwards is the time that the Sanskrit was in use.</p>

<p class='c014'>Plu or Flu is an ancient disease, so the Author of this Booklet
believes, and in confirmation thereof, cites the views of native
Indian Sanskrit scholars who have found the records of a pestilence,
resembling the Flu away back in the mists of antiquity,
1200 B.C.</p>

<p class='c014'>This disease repeatedly ravaged the then centers of dense
population, Central Asia, Mesopotamia and Southern Asia, in
the reigns of Tiglath Pileser (1120–00) and Nebuchadnezzar
(605–562). The sickness affected the citizens of ancient Babylon;
and the described features of the epidemics were such as we have
today in those of Influenza, cough, headache, fever, pain in the
eyeballs, and copious tears and water gushing from the nose,
stained with blood or all blood. The Sanskrit historians gave the
name “Plu” to the disease, probably from the flowing nasal discharge.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is an uncanny coincidence, that our Hawaiian people, who
are descended from the Indian branch of the Indo-European
family of nations, use the softer letter p in pronouncing the
shortened form of the word Influenza, Plu for Flu.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unknowingly, the Hawaiians are using probably the word
that their ancestors used 2,500 years ago in India on the banks
of the river Sindhu or Indus.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>EXPLANATION OF MEDICAL WORDS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Before entering upon a description of the epidemics of Influenza,
which have ravaged the various countries of the world,
it is essential to explain the meanings of certain medical words
used in connection with epidemic, contagious and infectious
diseases.</p>

<p class='c014'>The definitions which are given, if not exactly orthodox, are
fairly in accord with modern views, and are clear, simple, and
should be easily understood by any ordinary reader.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><i>Infectious.</i> A disease acquired without any direct contact
with a sick person; the infection may be carried by a person in
apparent good health, or by any intermediary substance, or by the
entrance of a non-immune person into a room, house, or any
place of human residence, or occupied as such; where there has
been recently any infectious disease, such as Flu, Scarlet Fever,
Measles or Small-pox, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Infection.</i> The entrance into the system or body of living
disease producing germs, such as by</p>

<p class='c014'>(a) Droplet infection; bacteria infected minute particles
or droplets, ejected by sneezing, coughing, spitting and talking.</p>

<p class='c014'>(b) Aerial dust particles coated with bacteria.</p>

<p class='c014'>(c) Mixed, more than one bacterium or organism present
in the system, they may enter together or one precede the other.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Contagious.</i> A disease acquired from a direct contact with
the sick.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Contagion.</i> The spreading of a disease by direct or indirect
contact.</p>

<p class='c014'>(a) Direct contagion.</p>

<p class='c014'>(b) Indirect contagion or mediate, as by a “carrier,” who
is apparently in good health, but nevertheless carries disease and
can convey it to other non-immune persons.</p>

<p class='c014'>(c) By means of Fomites (hereafter defined).</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Contagium.</i> The virus or poison which transmits disease,
such as the vaccine used in anti-smallpox vaccination, which in
former years was obtained from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vacca</span> or cow, now the calf
is the source of supply.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Fomites.</i> Any non-animate agents or substances that transmit
contagion such as blankets, towels, handkerchiefs, or any
articles which have been contaminated by the secretions or excretions
of the sick.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Endemic.</i> A disease which is permanently present in a
people or district, it may become epidemic.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Epidemic.</i> A rapidly and widely spreading disease attacking
many people.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Pandemic.</i> A wide and rapidly spreading Epidemic affecting
many people and all countries.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Sporadic.</i> A disease occurring here and there, not attacking
many people, not widely spread nor epidemic.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Incubation.</i> The period between the implanting or acquiring
of a communicable disease and its development; and visible by
external signs or other recognisable manifestations.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>INFLUENZA IN HAWAII.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Previous to the year 1889 Hawaii had been tolerably free
from the “Flu.” Such cases which had appeared in former years
were of a mild character, as were also those which prevailed
during the 1889–90 epidemic. Epidemic Catarrh has been known
in the Hawaiian Islands for many years. The Annals of the
early Missionary Fathers mention it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dr. Alonzo Chapin, an early Missionary physician, refers to
it; on page 39 of the Author’s “Monograph on Leprosy,” is the
following quotation taken from the Doctor’s writings in the
years 1836–37: (in Hawaii) “Diseases occur epidemically, as
was the case with Catarrh, repeatedly.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This epidemic catarrh was probably Influenza in a mild form;
or it may have been the epidemic catarrh of the kind known
to the physicians of today, as that caused by the Micro-coccus
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catarrhalis</span>, a globular or spheroid shaped micro-organism.</p>

<p class='c014'>South Wind Catarrh: In Hawaii during the season when
the South wind prevails, from November to March, epidemic
and infectious colds are very common. They are attended with
disagreeable frontal headache, nasal discharge, sore throat, fever,
aching limbs and body; these are cases of mild “Flu.” Elderly
people, middle aged and old foreign residents, and our Aboriginal
population are those mostly affected.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hawaii today, due to great increase of travel, greater speed
of ocean steamers, and its cosmopolitan population, is probably
infected, like all other ports of the U. S. A., with several different
species or strains of the Influenza Bacillus, and also those
of the Micro-coccus Catarrhalis.</p>

<h4 class='c012'><i>Contagious Nature of Colds or Catarrhs, so Called.</i></h4>

<p class='c013'>It is a well known fact, that when isolated peoples are visited
by strangers, whether they arrive by sea or land, epidemic colds
speedily appear amongst the residents of these localities.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Esquimaux, Indian tribes, residents of South Sea
Islands, Caroline, Marshall and Marquesa groups, Pitcairn Island,
etc.; isolated peoples and out of the track of travel, when visited
by strangers, become affected with epidemic catarrh and cough,
which may attack great numbers of them and cause high mortality.
Those visitors who carry the germs of the Catarrh show no
visible signs of disease themselves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Possible sources of Disease: During the past four centuries
there is clear evidence that Hawaii has been infected with diseases
from certain sources; there is also evidence that is not
so clear, yet it is worthy of consideration. From what countries
could ships carry diseases to Hawaii before the opening up of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the Islands to foreign trade? Spain, China, Japan and Russia.
Since the opening up of the islands to foreign commerce, the ships
of all nations have carried to Hawaii a varied assortment of diseases,
some nearly harmless, but others of the deadliest kind.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the past centuries there are credible records of Spanish
visitors, also of Chinese and Japanese, and of a people coming
in Praus and Junks with “tufts of hair on their faces,” Formosans,
whose speech has an alliance with the Malayo-Polynesian and
hence Hawaiian.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the present time numerous ships which visit Honolulu
carry infectious and contagious diseases amongst their crews and
passengers, especially those who travel in the steerage.</p>

<p class='c014'>What occurs today at known intervals on a very large scale,
most probably happened on a smaller scale at extended and unknown
intervals in past centuries; diseases were introduced to
Hawaii, and carried from here.</p>

<p class='c014'>Castaways and shipwrecked mariners can carry diseases to
the shores they arrive at, the same as other voyagers, and probably
did so to Hawaii.</p>

<p class='c014'>If there was no Tuberculosis in Hawaii before the coming
of the Foreigner, then where do the ancient Hawaiian words
“<span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">hookii</span>,” “<span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">akepau</span>” come from? <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Hookii</span> means, in English, to
grow thin in flesh, to waste away; <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">akepau</span> means to consume,
to finish, hence to eat away.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even today inspection of arrivals from oversea ports, and
even limited quarantine carefully carried out by competent officials,
is not always an effective protection against the introduction
of infectious and contagious diseases into any country.</p>

<p class='c014'>The following list of contagious and infectious diseases
eluded the Quarantine officials at the port of Honolulu and infected
the town, some later infected other Islands of the group.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>THE EPIDEMIC OF 1889–90.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The 10th Pandemic which had its origin in the month of
March, 1889, at Bukhara, Russian Turkestan, ultimately reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Hawaii, both from Japan and San Francisco: from the former
country in August of that year, and from the latter city in
December.</p>

<p class='c014'>Influenza became epidemic in the Islands in the year 1890, in
the months of January, February, March and practically ceased
to exist in the latter part of April. Its morbidity was extensive,
its death rate almost nil.</p>

<p class='c014'>Extract from the Report of the President of the Board
of Health to the Legislature: session of 1890.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Early in the autumn of the year 1889 a disease started in
Russia, which on that account took the name of the Russian
disease.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It spread rapidly over Europe and the British Isles; very
soon it crossed the Atlantic, and with extreme rapidity spread
over the whole continent of North America.</p>

<p class='c014'>Early in January, 1890, Dr. Trousseau, the port physician, reported
many cases existing among passengers, on the mail
steamer en route to the Colonies.</p>

<p class='c014'>In its journey westward from its initial starting point in
Russia to the confines of California, its march has been marked
by great prevalence and fatality.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Hawaii with its mild and salubrious climate, its intensity
is greatly modified, and although it caused great distress and
physical suffering, very few deaths have resulted from it. This
disease has prevailed as an epidemic on several former occasions
under the name of Influenza. Other extracts from the same
Report are as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>Agent Reynolds, “Influenza has visited most of the families
in town since its arrival, but deaths have been few.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dr. S. B. Swift, “At Kalaupapa, females at the Bishop
Home were most affected.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dr. Jared Smith, Kauai. “Extreme prevalence of Influenza
of mild type, began the middle of January.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dr. D. Campbell, Waimea, Kauai. “Influenza widespread.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dr. Greenfield, Hamakua, Hawaii. “No Influenza epidemic.
Catarrh and Bronchitis; wet and cold weather.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Dr. G. Herbert. Wailuku, Maui. “One-third of the population
affected: at least 3,000 cases. One Pneumonia case fatal.
Symptoms: Fever, frontal and occipital headache, spinal and
limb pains. Pulmonary congestion and occasionally Pneumonia.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On or about the 20th of August, 1889, recently arrived
Japanese laborers had Influenza in a mild form.</p>

<p class='c014'>This shipment on arrival from Japan, at Honolulu, were
transferred immediately from the ocean steamer to the deck of
an Inter-Island one, and were landed direct at Onomea and
Hakalau plantations.</p>

<p class='c014'>The type of Influenza was very mild, never infected other
laborers; those who had the disease were segregated for a week.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Onomea there were nine cases, at Hakalau eleven.
(Author.)</p>

<p class='c014'>The epidemic of 1890 left a trail of its own, somewhat different
from the way it had acted as an epidemic; for almost
a decade cases of the nervous type frequently kept cropping
out; these were attended with Insomnia, great prostration, severe
neuritis and facial neuralgia; frequent attacks and relapses
in the intervals, of this Nervous form of Influenza, were
responsible for the decease of Honolulu’s most prominent physician
in the year of 1894.</p>

<p class='c014'>The last, and fatal attack, the Doctor believed he acquired
from visitors to Honolulu from Siberia, that country and European

<h3 class='c012'>DENGUE.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Dengue in its initial stage or degree of progress in some
respects resembles the Flu, and is often mistaken for it. Such
was the case in the years 1900–1901 when imported laborers from
Porto Rico, W. I. carried the Dengue or Breakbone fever with
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>This disease has practically disappeared, a sporadic case of
it comes to light now and then. Its transmission by the Mosquito,
Culex fatigans, is not yet definitely determined.</p>

<p class='c014'>A new and more virulent type or species of the Influenza
Bacillus was carried overseas to the port of Honolulu in the third
week of June, 1918, and spread to the residents of the town; and
it was this new imported type of Influenza that was responsible
for the high mortality in the epidemics of that disease in 1918–1920,
due to Influenza and complicating Pneumonia, the so-called
Pulmonary or Pneumonic form of the disease.</p>

<p class='c014'>All these matters have been fully described in the public
press, and in part in the Reports of the Board of Health, which

<h3 class='c012'>GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c022'><i>Contents—Effect of Influenza on Man; Pulmonary Influenza
or Influenza-Pneumonia; Immunity; Incubation; Salient
Points; Quarantine; Cause of “Flu”; Why Microbes
Created; Flu Preventatives; Hours When Flu Attacks;
Salient Points.</i></p>

<p class='c014'><i>Effect of Influenza on Man.</i> When the Influenza Bacillus
or Microbe has gained access to the system of man, it speedily
produces an acute infectious toxaemia or blood poisoning, due
to the toxin or poison liberated in the blood by the Bacillus;
there are also other disease producing micro-organisms found
in the sputum or spit of the Influenza victim; these are spheroid
or bead shaped and called Cocci (kokkos, a berry, Greek), which
apparently aid the B Influenza as allies of destruction to our
systems.</p>

<p class='c014'>The effects of the “Flu” poisoning on the human lung somewhat
resembles the conditions seen in those who have died from
inhaling strong Chlorine gas, Carbon mon-oxide or Nitrogen
gases in an atmosphere devoid of Oxygen.</p>

<p class='c014'>The type or general character of the “Flu” which has prevailed
in Hawaii during the past two years, especially in Honolulu
in the months of January, February, March and April, 1920,
is the highest development of destructiveness to man, that the
B Influenza is capable of. It was the true Russian Catarrh or
Malignant “Flu,” and so called by the Italians Catarro Russo
and not Influente or Influenza. This type of the “Flu” was reintroduced
into the U. S. A. in the spring of 1918.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>INFLUENZA-PNEUMONIA.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Pulmonary Influenza or Influenza-Pneumonia frequently
complicates the “Flu” in some epidemics, but not in all of them;
it is the main cause for the mortality due to that disease.</p>

<p class='c014'>A century and a half ago the French physicians first demonstrated
its peculiarities, and its difference from ordinary Pneumonia,
which is as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>(a) It develops gradually and complicates the Bronchitis
of Influenza.</p>

<p class='c014'>(b) Its peculiar physical signs are: the respiratory murmur
in the early stages of the “Flu” is diminished, and later completely
disappears; then bronchial breathing begins without dullness
or crepitant rales, like true Pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Hawaii as elsewhere, the complicating Pneumonia seldom
appears before the second or third day; occasionally it comes to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the fore after the fifth or sixth; it is not always easy of detection
in a mild case. In our epidemic in Honolulu last winter,
1920, some of cases considered as Pneumonia were in fact those
of simple Pulmonary congestion and oedema, attended with expectoration
of frothy blood-tinged mucus, resembling the swollen
or drowned lung found in those who have been submerged and
died from drowning.</p>

<p class='c014'>The true Influenza-Pneumonia sputum or spit is “greenish-yellow,”
this greenish color being due to the presence in the
sputum of a green pigment excreted by the diplo-coccus or double
coccus, like a necklace of beads, or sometimes resembling rounded
small rods.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>LEGACIES OF THE “FLU” TO MAN.</h3>

<p class='c013'>A tendency to T. B., softening of the heart muscle, nervous
prostration, insomnia, restlessness and inability for brain work,
depression of spirits and irritability of temper, neuralgias, middle
ear disease, eye troubles, vertigo or giddiness from the ear disease
or eye or heart; stomach disease after intestinal influenza,
vomiting spells, etc., etc., emaciation, diarrhoea.</p>

<p class='c014'>The open air life of the occupants of T. B. hospitals accounts
for their freedom from epidemic “Flu”; but they are
not immune to every epidemic. Residents of asylums, hospitals,
and jails are not so fortunate, numbers of the inmates being attacked;
daily rations of quinine should be given.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>IMMUNITY THE KING PROTECTOR.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Paradoxical as the statement may appear, the mild and balmy
climate of the Hawaiian Islands, or any other place, neither protects
nor prevents any person from being attacked by the Influenza.</p>

<p class='c014'>A mild climate is not a factor of prevention against any infectious
or contagious disease: the dominant agent and king of
protectors is an IMMUNITY inherited or acquired.</p>

<p class='c014'>Climate cannot alter, change or prevent any person from being
infected with Small-pox, Plague, Cholera, Scarlet Fever,
Typhus or Influenza.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the presence of King “Flu” all men are not equal, those
who have had several attacks of the disease in former years, or
have recently had it, are fairly Immune, not absolutely so; but
others who have not recently had Flu are liable to become infected
with it, and may be stricken at any time.</p>

<p class='c014'>Good living, careful personal hygiene, fresh air in abundance,
avoidance of over heated and poorly ventilated rooms, together
with a general high standard of living, are excellent in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>way to prevent ordinary disease; but in so far as they can prevent
any one from being infected by the Flu, the absolute
protection is entirely lacking in them; none of these very essential
hygienic principles can produce IMMUNITY, which
is the SOLE protector from an attack, or more than one attack
of Influenza, and it is Nature’s standby, and by means of
which it braces up the system to convalescence and ultimate
recovery.</p>

<p class='c014'>Successful Vaccination against Small-pox will prevent or
render mild an attack of that disease, in 95% of those who have
been vaccinated and re-vaccinated. A baby in arms if successfully
vaccinated is Immune and protected; whereas an unvaccinated
giant living in a balmy climate, should he contract Small-pox,
will probably be a candidate for a coffin or the furnace of
a Crematory.</p>

<p class='c014'>A mild climate cannot alter nor render less harmful to the
system of man, the specific toxin or poison of Influenza once
it is liberated into his blood; nor the toxin of any other micro-organism
of the infectious type.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the combat with disease, many of the advantages of our
Hawaiian climate are to a certain extent neutralised by a lack
of stamina and disease resistance (and also the neglecting to
call in the services of a physician at an early stage of the illness)
of some of our inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c014'>Any person who is affected with symptoms of disease, such
as fever, headache, nasal discharge, cough, sore and tickling
throat, and lassitude, during the prevalence of Flu, epidemic or
sporadic, should take to bed, and by so doing, it may mean and
is in line with a quick recovery, and a mild case of that disease:
whereas fighting off the disease and struggling to pursue
one’s daily avocation may change a mild type of illness to a very
grave and hopeless one. In this respect Influenza resembles Typhoid
fever of the ambulatory type, the victim does not realize
how sick he is, but when the hour comes that exhausted body
and brain forces him to seek his bed, it is often too late, and
death or prolonged sickness awaits him. Frequently the athlete
and the physically strong, when stricken with Flu, refrain from
early rest, struggle against the inroads of the disease, exhaust
their recuperative powers, and when finally driven to bed, collapse
and die: whereas a weaker individual being speedily overcome,
gives up and takes early to bed and recovers.</p>

<p class='c014'>The death rate amongst those who are attacked by the
“Flu” varies in each epidemic and pandemic; as a fair average,
approximately most recover, say 75%; incomplete recovery 15%;
and in the late epidemic in Honolulu, the winter of 1920, the
death rate was 8% to 10%; in the U. S. A. it was 4% to 6%;
and in Europe 4½%.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>INCUBATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Great discrepancies occur in the statements of different observers,
but inasmuch as each epidemic varies in severity, a severe
type of the “Flu” may have a shorter incubative period than a
mild type, and therefore taking the variations in type into consideration,
may reconcile the differences. If Influenza was accompanied
with a facial eruption or exanthem, this would materially
assist in the determination of its Incubative period. In
Hawaii, two to three days is the most frequent period of Incubation;
it may vary, however, from 24 hours to 72 hours, even to
five days; in these long incubative cases, headache, aching eyeballs,
and great languor are the indicating signs, and those persons
so affected succumb slowly and offer great resistance to
the overpowering toxins of the Bacillus Influenzae.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Immunity which a person may possess in one Epidemic
and not in another, may be accounted for by assuming that each
Epidemic may have a difference in the strain or the species of
the Influenza bacillus.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SALIENT POINTS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Period of Life. Most cases occur between 20 and 40 years.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Schools. The older children are first attacked: open air
schools are a positive, but not an absolute defense against Infection.</p>

<p class='c014'>Indoor Schools. The ratio of prevalence amongst children of
all ages is 40%.</p>

<p class='c014'>Outdoor Schools. All ages, the ratio of prevalence is 10%.</p>

<p class='c014'>Open Air Occupations. Such as workers in the fields, 12%
are attacked.</p>

<p class='c014'>Closed Rooms. Factory Operatives, 49% are attacked.</p>

<p class='c014'>MAIN FACTOR OF SPREAD. Not the Weather, but
HUMAN intercourse, especially Commerce; the greater the
speed of Commerce, the greater and quicker is the spread of the
Flu; it follows the path of HUMAN travel; it is a Contagion
solely spread by HUMAN intercourse, viz. “The Influenza Carrier
or Carriers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Positions in life, which require contact with Travelers, necessarily
influence and spread the disease.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Flu” is spread in the same ratio of speed as the Carrier
of IT.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the Flu is a weakling, his best Nurses and Foster-Mothers
are Overcrowding and lack of Pure Air.</p>

<p class='c014'>Where the Crowd is, there the Flu is: little crowding means
little Flu; plenty of Crowding, plenty of Flu.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Period of Isolation, for ordinary Flu patients: 12 days.</p>

<p class='c014'>Period of Isolation, for Influenza-Pneumonia cases, until the
end of Convalescence.</p>

<p class='c014'>Quarantine and Isolation are beset with difficulties owing to
the extraordinary contagious nature of the Flu, due to the multiplicity
of Contacts, Carriers, and mild undetected cases.</p>

<p class='c014'>It should be borne in mind that Influenza is a most refractory
disease, and not at any time or season is it under our control,
and to bring about this condition is as yet an unsolved problem.</p>

<p class='c014'>It may attack us at any time, although its favorite period of
appearance is the Autumn and Winter months.</p>

<p class='c014'>Influenza is mainly a Respiratory disease, hence Isolation and
Quarantine cannot be relied upon to prevent the spread of the
Flu, and both of these restraints of personal liberty and hindrances
of commerce must fail, besides being also unpractical
and impossible.</p>

<p class='c014'>People must meet to transact business in public places, must
eat and drink in public, use telephones in public places, use public
lavatories, and many other acts of public nature; all of these
acts cannot be quarantined, nor can talking amongst crowds;
even if rigid quarantine rules were enforced, the Flu has hitherto
eluded them and spread outside of the quarantined limits.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>CAUSE OF THE FLU.</h3>

<p class='c013'>In the absence of any alleged cause or theory, which can account
for the erratic prevalence of the Flu, the Author advances
the following:</p>

<p class='c014'>(a) The Bacillus of Influenza normally cannot exist or
thrive in our every-day ordinary atmosphere, constituted of 20%
of Oxygen, and 80% of Nitrogen.</p>

<p class='c014'>(b) Under certain atmospheric conditions, such as any fractional
excess above 4–5 Nitrogen, the normal amount present in
the air, the Bacillus of Flu can become acclimated and acquires
new sources of vitality, viz., the means to exist in the presence
of Oxygen, and to thrive and multiply in it, and propagate, in
this temporarily changed atmosphere. It speedily becomes imbued
with virulent disease producing properties, multiplies on a
vast scale, and proceeds to attack and scourge man; hence an
Epidemic of Flu is brought into our lives.</p>

<p class='c014'>(c) Later when the normal atmospheric balance is restored,
the Bacillus ceases to be pathogenic or disease producing, loses
its power, Facultative or Potential, to multiply and live on a large
scale, but certain of the most vigorous members of the Colony
survive and remain dormant, and latent, and years or months later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>under the same favorable atmospheric conditions, Nitrogen excess
in the atmosphere, become active and produce a New Epidemic
of Flu.</p>

<p class='c014'>Each Epidemic may be considered as a sprouting of the
“seed” of the previous or past ones; such seed or microbe is not
permanently nursed by any host, such as man or animal, as a carrier;
but the Bacillus lies hidden in the dust of rooms, attics,
books, packed away clothes, towels, non-sterilized fomites in general,
especially blankets and handkerchiefs, wall paper, etc.; on
premises which had been occupied by Flu victims or victim, or
convalescents from the disease, weeks, months, or years before.</p>

<p class='c014'>No disease producing microbe can develop itself anew, it
must come from the seed of the old stock, whether it be Flu,
Typhoid, Plague, T. B., or Small-pox. Like produces, and only
can produce like, is an infallible law, and applies to every living
microbe, malignant or harmless.</p>

<p class='c014'>Anything with life, when the entire species is eradicated or
destroyed, with no live members or parents surviving, is absolutely
gone for ever, save and except the Supreme deity sees fit to
regenerate it.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Honolulu, how uncomfortable we all feel when the South
wind prevails, with its excess humid atmosphere; Headaches,
Sweats, Sneezing, Lassitude and loss of appetite, etc., affects many
of us, and coughs and sore throats; this is the Sick wind or
atmosphere, so called by the Hawaiian; a condition of mild Flu
producing weather; akin to Nitrogen plus air, and Oxygen minus,
which the Author has suggested as an explanation of the cause
of dormant Influenza, developing into an Epidemic.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>WHY WERE MICROBES CREATED?</h3>

<p class='c013'>We have an abundance of non-disease producing microbes
dwelling in our bodies, and also many other harmless micro-organisms
pervade the lower strata of our atmosphere; the upper
strata of the air are devoid of microbes, say five miles from the
surface of the earth, but inasmuch as human beings cannot breathe
in comfort at such a high elevation, we cannot escape germs of
disease by residing at great heights.</p>

<p class='c014'>The harmless microbes inhabiting our bodies are good friends
and protectors; disease producing microbes may have been created
for the purpose of maintaining a bacterial balance, not too much
of one kind nor too little of the other.</p>

<p class='c014'>If Providence intended to decimate mankind and destroy
him by microbic diseases, one species of a deadly and virulent microbe
would suffice.</p>

<p class='c014'>Micro-organisms, in order to live and exist, must find suitable
surroundings and pabulum; if these are lacking, they must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>perish. Man and animals, in the main, furnish the homes and
food which enables a microbe to exist; and when death destroys
the “host,” the parasitic microbe still lives in the body of its victim
when buried in the ground; hence the necessity for cremation,
which is the ideal and most efficient method of disposing of the
corpses of those who have died of infectious diseases.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>SPORES HAVE GREAT VITALITY.</h3>

<p class='c013'>The Creator, by introducing microbic life to our globe, must
have intended it to live and propagate; bacteria are provided
with a wonderful defense against eradication; this is evident in
the protection designed for the Spore or Re-productive element
of Bacteria, whose coat or outer cell envelope is one of “the most
resisting substances to destruction in the Organic world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Agents, that cause other forms of life to succumb, fail to
destroy it; the average spore when subjected to a dry heat temperature
of 300° Fahr. for one hour is apparently still alive;
it requires this same temperature to be maintained for several
hours in order to destroy it.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is an unalterable law of life, that every living species
grows old and ultimately perishes; even one day’s existence to
a microbe may combine birth, infancy, maturity and old age.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is impossible to believe or to think, that our Creator is
always creating new or fresh supplies of Flu microbes or any
kind of the disease producing ones; whether microbes survived
the Deluge, or were post Pluvial creations is a moot point? if
Noah took microbes into the Ark and preserved them by Divine
order, for future liberation amongst mankind, he certainly did
his work efficiently in so far as the species of the Influenza bacillus
is concerned; it has lost none of its virulency or vigorousness
in the year 1920, after living 6,000 years.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>PREVENTIVES OF INFLUENZA?</h3>

<p class='c013'>Are there any Influenza preventives? Serums, of late years
have been the chief agents used for preventing and treating the
Flu.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a preventive remedy, the immunity (?) or protection afforded
is very brief, and it ceases to be of value in a few weeks.</p>

<p class='c014'>In Hawaii, the Author has not been greatly impressed with
the value of Serums in the treatment of Influenza; the alleged
great benefits and cures set forth in Medical papers, and publications
of laboratory statistics by manufacturers of the Serums
are not obtained here.</p>

<p class='c014'>Serums after injection are supposed to aggravate all the
symptoms of Flu, followed later by a great improvement in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>patient’s condition, but this prophecy is not always borne out;
hence the increase of the headache, fever and pains in the limbs
and aching bones, alarms and frightens the patient of the Asiatic,
Hawaiian races and many of the Caucasians.</p>

<p class='c014'>Amongst cases of Influenza, lying side by side, those treated
by simple remedies recovered just as speedily and safely as those
who had undergone the Serum treatment, and were attended with
much less discomfort.</p>

<p class='c014'>QUININE. The bi-sulphate of Quinine is one of the best
haemal or blood microbicides that we have, and its daily use in
times of epidemics of Influenza may prevent the user of it from
being attacked. It is more a Preventive in some of the epidemics
than in others, the ratio of prevention is 40–60, sometimes more,
sometimes less; the remedy is easily taken, and in small doses has
no drawbacks; it is best so administered; it is cheap and in the
coated tablet form palatable, convenient; any person can take it
and pursue his usual avocation.</p>

<p class='c014'>After forty years of practice as a physician, the Author feels
convinced of the value of Quinine; he learned its value in western
Europe, even if the headache of Flu is very severe small trial
doses may be given, as the Author knows from personal experience
it is helpful; in a later stage of the disease, with excessive sweats,
cold clammy skin and aching bones, all due to cadaveric bacilli
circulating in the blood, give Quinine, and your patient or patients
will soon respond to its beneficial effects, their condition will
improve, and they will thank you and ask for the medicine.</p>

<p class='c014'>Should small doses upset the stomach, in very susceptible
persons, then it may be given by hypodermic injection, using the
more soluble salts of QUININE, the Lactate a white powder
soluble in 1 to 5 of water, or the Acid Hydrochloride of the
B P<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c020'><sup>[2]</sup></a>; in the U S P<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c020'><sup>[3]</sup></a> it is the Di-chloride, which is soluble
in less than its own weight of water; if small doses of Quinine
cause headache and ringing in the ears in a well person than
the remedy is unsuitable and should not be taken, for it will not
prevent an attack of the Flu in that person.</p>

<p class='c014'>Professor Dittmar Finkler, M.D., of the university of Bonn,
Rhenish Prussia, in his work on Influenza, cites the experiments
carried out by Dr. Graser, Medical Army Corps, on duty at the
cavalry barracks at Bonn, where five squadrons of German cavalry
were quartered during an Epidemic of Flu; one of the
squadrons, complement of men, was given daily rations of
Quinine for several weeks during the prevalence of the epidemic,
the other four squadrons received no Quinine; the results are

<p class='c014'>It is reasonable to assume, that the food or pabulum of the
bacillus of Influenza is poisoned by Quinine entering the blood,
hence the microbe will avoid by instinct any person whose blood
contains quinine in solution; if the bacillus has gained access
to the system it is speedily destroyed, and becomes cadaveric as
soon as it enters the zone of the quinine barrage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Are there Hours of the day when the System is more susceptible
to Invasion by the Bacillus Influenzae?</p>

<p class='c006'>To determine this question requires careful study, time, a
great deal of patient and tedious work and perseverance; yet it
is possible to gain some information on this phase of the “Flu.”</p>

<p class='c014'>At intervals, during the past twenty-one years, from more
than 1000 cases of Influenza in adults, the Author has managed
to collect 132 cases; wherein, it was possible to check and verify
with some degree of accuracy, the time of contact with a known
source of Flu; no subsequent contact being had with any other
known source of that disease.</p>

<p class='c014'>Material evidence was collected from isolated plantation
camps, sparsely inhabited villages, and the suburbs of Honolulu
at such times as there was no epidemic of Flu. A record of cases

<h3 class='c012'>SALIENT POINTS.</h3>

<p class='c013'>Care of the Flu patient. Ventilation of the sick room should
be carried out with due regard to the wishes of the patient. What
is a cooling agreeable breeze to the average Caucasian, may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>felt as an Arctic blast by the Hawaiians and Asiatic races; this
causes them to fret and worry.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a happy medium in ventilation of sick rooms, as in
all things. If the patient has Pneumonia, encourage resting on
the right or left side, changing from time to time; discourage
any patient from lying on the back.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Health of the Nurse. The Nurse must protect her own
health, by regular hours for work, rest, sleep, meals and exercise;
an overworked nurse is a non-efficient nurse, and it sends her along
the road to a breakdown and makes her or him more subject to
acquiring Flu from the patients.</p>

<p class='c014'>Practise nose breathing. Use sign language in the sick room;
keep the mouth closed; tightly closed lips are a better safeguard
than a Flu mask; mouth breathing is an inviter of infection;
anoint the lips and nostrils frequently with camphor vaseline, or
Spirits of Camphor; use no sprays for the nose or throat containing
alleged germ destroyers; gargle the throat with a little
Listerine water; by so doing you do not kill your protective
friends, the non-pathogenic Bacteria; these will get the best
of Mr. Flu in due time; leave the nose alone; germ killing sprays,
so-called, are useless and are a delusion; remember the “Flu”
bacillus is enclosed in a spray-proof coat, almost as tough as
Shark skin.</p>

<p class='c013'>Adam. Ivan. Krusenstern, Russian navigator, explorer and
scientist. Served and trained with the British navy from 1793 to
1799. In the year 1802, the Russian Government purchased two
ships from the British Admiralty, whose names were changed
to the “NEVA” and the (?) Don.</p>

<p class='c014'>After being refitted and provisioned, these ships left Kronstadt
in August, 1803, under the command of Captain Krusenstern,
on a voyage of exploration around Cape Horn; they called at
the Mendaña or Marquesa Islands, remained there four months,
making investigation of the resources of this group; later the
ships sailed for Hawaii, arriving on June 13, 1804; here also
an intensive study was made of the people, products of the
islands, harbors, fisheries, climate, etc.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ships returned to Kronstadt in 1806, and Captain Krusenstern
was advanced to the rank of Admiral; he is the Author
of “A Voyage Round the World,” in 3 volumes, 1810 and 1814,
in the Russian language; he also was the Cartographer of an
“Atlas of the Pacific Ocean.”</p>

word Okuu has two meanings which will be explained later.</p>

<p class='c014'>A description of the symptoms of the victims of the <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ahulau
Okuu</span>, as related to the Author in the year 1883, is herewith set
forth in the <i>words</i> of the narrators, grandchildren of some of
those who had been stricken with the <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ahulau Okuu</span>, but had
recovered.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Owing to the terrible pains in their stomachs, and the
cramps in the legs, those who had the New disease could neither
stand nor lie down: (hence the meaning of the word <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Okuu</span>, a
verb, to sit up because one has no place to lie down in comfort).</p>

<p class='c014'>“To obtain some relief from the pains, the sick people sat on
their hams or heels, with the body bowed forward clasping their
stomachs, or sat on the ground, their legs in front and the body
bowed in front over the legs. Thin stuff like sour starch water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>flowed from them very often; some vomited all the time; their
faces and bodies became black and cold as like they had died,
their eyes grew small and far in the head. They all the time
cried for water, for they had a great thirst. People died so fast
and so many, nobody was left to bury them.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The sick and the well ones who looked after them, lived
on baked sweet potatoes; the people were too tired and weary
to make the poi.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It often so happened, those who were not sick when they
began to cook the food for the sick ones, were taken with the
Ahulau Okuu, and died so quickly, falling over dead on the
face, before the potatoes had cooked.” (All the above described
conditions are typical of Cholera of the Asiatic type, the most
malignant form.) Author.</p>

<p class='c014'>The <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ahulau Okuu</span> ravaged all the Islands, and it is said to
have caused 22,000 deaths. Kamehameha I, then living on the
Island of Oahu, was stricken with the disease, but recovered.</p>

<p class='c014'>(A) The Hawaiian word <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Okuu</span>, a verb, means, to dismiss
or let go the Soul: It is applied to and accepted as describing the
last moments of those stricken with the pestilence of 1804: “they
dismissed freely their souls and died.” This explanation of the
meaning of Okuu is too vague. It gives no clue to the early
stages of the disease or its symptoms. The only conclusion that
can be safely drawn is that the <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Okuu</span> was a rapidly fatal and
epidemic malady.</p>

<p class='c014'>(B) The Author of this Booklet sought for, and found
years ago another Hawaiian word <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Okuu</span>, which throws some light
on the progress of the <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ahulau Okuu</span> previous to death, and it also
gives some insight as to what the pestilence could be or was;
furthermore to any physician of an intuitive mind, the translation
into English of the word <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Okuu</span>, “to dismiss freely and
let go the Soul in death” explains nothing.</p>

<p class='c014'>There are two words <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Okuu</span> in the Hawaiian language, spelt
alike and also pronounced alike, but entirely different in their
meanings; both are verbs. Lorrin Andrews in his Hawaiian dictionary,
a standard work, A.D. 1865. (q. v.), states the meaning
of the second <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Okuu</span> is “to have to sit up because one has no
place to lie down in comfort”; this aptly describes the misery
of a cholera victim; he or she cannot stand up, sit up, nor lie down
in comfort, because of the intense and continuous pains in the
belly, and cramps in the legs. Which of these two construings
of the word <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Okuu</span> gives the better and clearer explanation of
what the <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ahulau Okuu</span> really was, is left to the judgment of
the Reader.</p>

  <h3 class='c012'>A POLYNESIAN COLONY LIVES IN PELE LIILII<br /> A. D. 1920.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The Mentawe or Menekeawe Islands lie 70 miles off the
West coast of the Island of Sumatra, and the people of these
islands are the last and only Colony of Polynesians living in the
Malay Archipelago; all the other Polynesians have immigrated
and passed onward to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class='c014'>Menekeawe is a Polynesian word, hence used every day in
Hawaii; mene, means an axe or koi; <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">keawe</span>, means a bearer or
carrier, also <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Keawe</span> is the name of a man; hence we have the
hale or house of <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Keawe</span>, the temple of refuge at Honaunau, S.
Kona, Hawaii.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Menekeawe Islands are 21 in number, 4 large and 17
small; all are of volcanic formation; they lie offshore at the
base of the great mountain Indrapura, 12,500 feet, now a quiescent
volcano, and the alleged abode (pura) of Indra, the FIRE
GOD of the Indo-Aryan peoples, a King God of the Middle
Realm, the fire of the Air, the lightning.</p>

<p class='c014'>The four largest of this group of Islands are, Siberut, Sipora
or Sikatan, North and South Paggi; they are surrounded
by coral reefs and volcanic shoals, difficult of access due to a
huge surf. The area of all the islands is 1224 square miles,
about one-fifth the size of Hawaii net; their Lat. 1° South to
3° 30′; Long. 100° E.</p>

<p class='c014'>The people of the Menekeawe Islands in features, language
and customs have a distinct and remarkable affinity with the
Polynesians; they are almost a pure blooded race of ARYAN
stock, and they are the only survivors of an eastward emigration
of an Indo-Aryan people, who antedate the Malay peoples in
Sumatra, the Battas and others. The Menekeawes have not
fused nor mixed their blood with other Malay peoples; miscegenation,
if any, has been very rare.</p>

<p class='c006'>PELE’S HAIR is formed by whirlpools of scum floating on
the surface of the rapidly moving magma of boiling lava, and
blown by the wind over the rim of the lava basin. During heavy
rain, Pele ceases to spin her amber colored threads of glass. In
January, 1888, the Author collected the hair; analysis showed the
composition to be Silicate of Calcium 75%; Silicate of Calcium
Oxide 15%; Ferrous Carbonate, FeCO<sub>3</sub>, 7%; Ferrous Sulphate,
FeSO<sub>4</sub>, 3%; the “hair” is therefore a fused transparent amorphous
Silicate of Calcium; the amber color is due to the iron,
Fe salts.</p>

<p class='c006'>HALA: The Hala mountains are 40 miles west of the Indus
river and form the boundary between S. E. Persia and India.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>The town of Hala in Persia is the modern Bela; an Indian town
Hala is located on the bank of the Indus 25 miles north of Hydarabad
(the abode by the water). The Maikai mountains are found
S. of the Nerbudda river, Lat. 22° 30′ N; Long. 78° E. In Hawaii,
hala, a pineapple, a tree; as a verb, hala, to pass beyond, as death;
also Pahala, Halawa.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Hawaiian people speak of living in PELE: The great
volcanic islands around the Java Sea are this land. The great
island of Sumatra, 1100 miles long by 250 wide, 66 volcanic
centers, probably is the Hawaii Loa of the Hawaiians.</p>

<p class='c014'>Island of Java: Yawa, Hawa, Chawa, Mul Java of Ibn Batuta,
Jawa, Jawi, Jawah.</p>

<p class='c014'>Savii Loa is great Java, Sawaii or Savaii is Javaii; Savaiiki is
Javaiiki or little Java.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Arabs were the great ancient navigators and explorers;
they acquired their maritime skill and seamanship in
the Mediterranean, Red and Arabian seas and in the Persian
gulf.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Phoenicians acquired their marine training around
the islands in the Gulf of Persia.</p>

<p class='c014'>The ancestors of the Hawaiians could have learned their
marine skill, and probably did so, on the shores of the Arabian
Sea and off the estuary of the river Indus, also in the Bay of
Bengal and off the mouths of the River Ganges, and later, in
the seas of Indonesia.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Polynesians are pre-eminently a race of excellent
seamen, due to centuries of a sea-faring life. The early members
of that nation, upon their entry into the Pacific Ocean,
perhaps in dhows and praus, but later as canoe-men, were
skillful, fearless and as successful a race of navigators and explorers
as the world has ever produced; poorly fitted out for
ocean travel in frail craft; nevertheless the Polynesians pursued
boldly a course into an unknown, vast ocean, where possible
storms, thirst, starvation, shipwreck and death awaited
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some probable points of departure of the primal Polynesian
emigrants, seeking new homes in the various islands of
the Pacific, can be found at Sawaii and Kawaahae on the
north coast of the island of Ceram (?Ceylon), one of the Molucca
islands; thence they could pass due north up the Gilolo
channel and enter the Pacific, leaving Pulo Morotai (Island
of Molokai) to the northwest, then steering a course along the
north of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands due east
towards Samoa.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c014'>To escape the Mongoloid hordes, who were crushing and
crowding them out in Indonesia, the Polynesians in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>travels appear always from necessity and safety to have
chosen the path of least resistance, the ocean; with its currents
and winds, aided by sails and paddle power, it is a motor
of comparative ease and progress, and also of sustenance, providing
abundance of fish, <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">limu</span> (edible seaweed), etc.</p>

<p class='c014'>The early Polynesians, armed with their knowledge of
trade winds, ocean currents, the stars, and with their skill as
fishermen, reduced to a minimum the prospects of ocean disasters
or pilikias. On the ocean’s broad expanse no enemy
could ambuscade them, nor were perils of this kind liable to
be encountered. Under all the above conditions of ocean
traveling the Polynesian navigators were enabled to explore
and discover many new and  hitherto unknown islands in the
largest ocean of our globe, the Pacific.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c014'>The Polynesian speech or language is distinctly not of
Malay or Mongoloid origin; research indicates that Indonesia
was its home and that it must have been in use for centuries
before the Malay came into the field. Due to the invasion of
this race, some of their words became engrafted on to the Polynesian,
they did not and have not materially changed it, hence,
without any sufficient reason, the name Malayo-Polynesian is
in common use to designate a language which is 85 per cent.
Polynesian.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Polynesians are absolutely a separate and distinct
race from the Malays. The pure Polynesian type, such as
most of aboriginal Hawaiians, has the following characteristics:
Tall, skin brown or olive, brown eyes, abundant black
wavy hair, ARYAN features, cleanly, cheerful, artistic, intellectual,
gentle, polite and dignified, poetical, musical.</p>

<p class='c014'>Their long type of skull and its capacity resembles in part
the European. Every one of the above properties is lacking
in the Malay, but the ancient Hindu and the Persian possessed
every one of them; it is to these races that the primal Polynesians
can be traced and hence their identification in the Pacific
presents no problem that cannot be solved.</p>

<p class='c014'>William Marsden (1754–1836), “History of Sumatra,”
states: “All the Insular nations of the Pacific are colonies
from Indonesia or Malaysia, whose original home was the
great Island of SUMATRA, and their common speech the
Great Polynesian.”</p>

<h4 class='c012'>The Land of our Aryan Ancestors.</h4>

<p class='c013'>About 1400 B.C.—“The summer months are two, and the
winter months are ten, and these are cold; and when the winter
encompasses (us) with the worst of its annoyances it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>cold for the trees and the flowers, cold for the cattle, horses
and birds, and cold for the freezing-waters filled with the falling
snow.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Quoted from the sacred record of the Persians, kept by
the “Magi,” the priests of the Persians—the Wise Men of the
East; of the same class as those who carried to Mary, the
mother of Christ, gold, frankincense and myrrh (aromatic
germicides to protect the infant Christ from mumps, measles
and tonsilitis, etc., and also to purify the air of the living
quarters).</p>

<p class='c014'>The location of a land with only two summer months
must have been far to the north of the Caspian Sea, on the
banks of the River Rha or the Volga. Petrograd, in 60 degrees
N. Lat., has an average annual temperature of 38 degrees Fahr.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<h4 class='c012'>Farthest East in Polynesia.</h4>

<p class='c013'>Rapanui, or Easter Island: Seen by Captain Alvaro Mendaña,
June 24, 1595; visited by the Dutch Admiral, Jacob Roggeveen,
and his crew on Easter Sunday, 1722, hence the name
of the island, Easter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Inhabitants are today Polynesians who came from the
Marquesa Islands, some 1800 miles to the northwest of Rapanui.
A translation of one of their tablets bearing a hieroglyphic
inscription relates as follows:</p>

<p class='c014'>“In that happy land, that beautiful land, where Romaha
lived before with his beloved Hangora; that beautiful land that
was governed by the Gods from heaven; who lived in the
water when it was cold; where the Black and White pointed
Spider would have climbed to heaven, but was stopped by the
falling snow and the freezing cold.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This very unique narrative probably harks back to northwest
India; Ramachandra, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu,
the Polynesian Tangaroa, and the black and white spider is
the winter solstice, similar to the Hawaiian astronomy, <span lang="haw" xml:lang="haw">Ke
alanui polohiwa a ke Kuukuu</span> (the black luminous orbit of the
Spider).</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
